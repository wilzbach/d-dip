== Abstract ==
Currently the version of "deprecated" that takes a string literal describing the deprecation can be used as an attribute, but not a storage class. The version that does not take a description can be used as both. This DIP will make the use of the "deprecated" attribute/storage class more consistent.

== Rationale ==
It is confusing to the users of D that the following code compiles:
<syntaxhighlight lang="D">
deprecated i = 10;
</syntaxhighlight>
but the following code does not:
<syntaxhighlight lang="D">
deprecated("This field will be removed in March 2017") i = 10;
</syntaxhighlight>

== Grammar Change ==
"deprecated" will be removed from the "StorageClass" grammar and replaced with "DeprecatedAttribute".

== Backwards Compatability ==
Because this change will allow previously invalid code to be valid, no old code will need to be upgraded.
