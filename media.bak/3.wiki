== Abstract ==
Non-public inheritance in a single inheritance language that has a single root object hierarchy makes little sense.

== Rationale ==
Hiding 'Object' level attributes from a class leads to strange behavior.

== Description ==
The compiler is behaving as spec'ed, but the value and correctness of this part of the spec is in question. 

The suggested change, effectively drop one line from the grammar.

<syntaxhighlight lang="d">
    SuperClass?:
        Identifier
        Protection Identifier // delete
</syntaxhighlight>

An alternative would be for Object to always be forced to public visibility even if there's a break in the public chain up to it.
