Abstract
--------

The @nogc function attribute will mark a function as not making any
allocations using the GC.

Rationale
---------

Many users want to be able to guarantee that code will not allocate
using the GC.

Description
-----------

@nogc goes in the same way that the nothrow attribute does, and is quite
similar in behavior. It affects inheritance in that it is covariant. The
name mangling for it will be "Ni". @nogc will be inferred for template
functions in the same manner as nothrow is. @nogc will be transitive, in
that all functions called by an @nogc function must also be @nogc. GC
allocations in a @nogc function will be disallowed, and that means calls
to operator new, closures that allocate on the GC, array concatenation,
array appends, and some array literals.

No functions in the GC implementation will be marked @nogc.

Usage
-----

@nogc int func(int a) { ... }

Static allocations should be ignored
------------------------------------

This code (and its mutable \_\_gshared variants) should work since the
beginning:

` void foo() @nogc nothrow {`
`     static const err = new Error("error");`
`     throw err;`
` }`

The situation is similar to this code, that is allowed (text is not
nothrow, but here it's called at compile-time):

`   void foo() nothrow {`
`       import std.conv;`
`       enum msg = text(10);`
`   }`

Behaviour in presence of optimizations
--------------------------------------

Using Escape Analysis the LDC2 compiler is able to remove the heap
allocation from this main function when full optimizations are used.
However, validity of code should not be affected by optimization
settings. (Nor can it be, without intertwining the compiler front-end
with each back-end in rather complicated ways.) Hence the following main
function cannot be annotated with @nogc even when Escape Analysis
removes the heap allocation:

`   __gshared int x = 5;`
`   int main() {`
`       int[] a = [x, x + 10, x * x];`
`       return a[0] + a[1] + a[2];`
`   }`

In a successive development phase of @nogc we can perhaps relax some of
its strictness introducing some standard (required by all conformant D
compilers and performed at all optimization levels) common cases of
escape analysis, that allow to use @nogc annotations in more cases,
perhaps also like the one above. One possible disadvantage of this idea
is that such escape analysis could slow down a little all D
compilations, even the fastest debug builds.
