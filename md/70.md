In a Nutshell
-------------

This proposal requires that covariant attribute inference for all
functions already exist. When and if that happens, introduce an
attribute (suggested names: **@api**, **extern(noinfer)**) which tells
the compiler to mangle the name and generate the .di interface with only
the function's explicit attributes and not its inferred ones. This is to
stabilize the linking API, and may also be useful in enforcing
discipline. See the [full
article](http://forum.dlang.org/post/vlzwhhymkjgckgyoxlrq@forum.dlang.org).

Note: This DIP was created more-or-less as a stub, to gather relevant
links and to preserve the idea for future reference. This DIP may be
made irrelevant by a more comprehensive system which statically
\*guarantees\* a connection between a .di interface file and its
corresponding binary object, as suggested by Dicebot(DIP forthcoming,
see above link).

Also relevant is [DIP45](http://wiki.dlang.org/DIP45), which addresses a
different linking concern and served to inspire [Dicebot's forthcoming
proposal](http://forum.dlang.org/post/otejdbgnhmyvbyaxatsk@forum.dlang.org).
