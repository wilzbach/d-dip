Abstract
--------

D offers a number of features aimed at systems-level coding, such as
unrestricted pointers, casting between integers and pointers, and the
[`@system`](http://dlang.org/function.html#system-functions) attribute.
These means, combined with the other features of D, make it a complete
and expressive language for systems-level tasks. On the other hand,
economy of means should be exercised in defining such powerful but
dangerous features. Most other features should offer good safety
guarantees with little or no loss in efficiency or expressiveness. This
proposal makes `ref` provide such a guarantee: with the proposed rules,
it is impossible in safe code to have `ref` refer to a destroyed object.
The restrictions introduced are not entirely backward compatible, but
disallow code that is stylistically questionable and that can be easily
replaced either with equivalent and clearer code.

In a nutshell
-------------

This DIP proposes that any `ref` parameter that a function received and
also wants to return must be also annotated with `return`. Annotation
are deduced for templates and lambdas, but must be explicit for all
other declarations. Example:

``` {.D}
@safe:
ref int fun(ref int a) { return a; } // ERROR
ref int gun(return ref int a) { return a; } // FINE
ref T hun(T)(ref T a) { return a; } // FINE, templates use deduction
```

Description
-----------

Currently, D has some provisions for avoiding dangling references:

``` {.D}
ref int fun(int x) {
  return x; // Error: escaping reference to local variable x 
}

ref int gun() {
  int x;
  return x; // Error: escaping reference to local variable x 
}

struct S {
    int x;
}

ref int hun() {
  S s;
  return s.x; // see https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13902
}

ref int iun() {
  int a[42];
  return a[5]; // see https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13902
}
```

However, this enforcement is shallow (even after fixing [issue
13902](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13902)). The following
code compiles and allows reads and writes through defunct stack
locations, bypassing scoping and lifetime rules:

``` {.D}
ref int identity(ref int x) {
  return x; // pass-through function that does nothing 
}

ref int fun(int x) {
  return identity(x); // escape the address of a parameter 
}

ref int gun() {
  int x;
  return identity(x); // escape the address of a local
}

struct S {
    int x;
    ref int get() { return x; }
}

ref int hun(S x) {
  return x.get; // escape the address of a part of a parameter 
}

ref int iun() {
  S s;
  return s.get; // escape the address of part of a local
}

ref int jun() {
  return S().get; // worst contender: escape the address of a part of an rvalue
}
```

The escape patterns are obvious in these simple examples that make all
code available and use no recursion, and may be found automatically. The
problem is that generally the compiler cannot see the body of `identity`
or `S.get()`. We need to devise a method that derives enough information
for safety analysis only given the function signatures, not their
bodies.

This DIP devises rules that allow passing objects by reference *down*
into functions, and return references *up* from functions, whilst
disallowing cases such as the above when a reference passed up ends up
referring to a deallocated temporary.

### Adding `return` as a parameter attribute

The main issue is typechecking functions that return a `ref` `T` and
accept some of their parameters by `ref`. Those that attempt to return
locals or parts thereof are already addressed directly, contingent to
[Issue 13902](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13902). The one
case remaining is allowing a function returning `ref` `T` to return a
(part of a) parameter passed by `ref`.

The key is to distinguish legal from illegal cases. One simple but
overly conservative option would be to simply disallow returning a `ref`
parameter or part thereof. That makes `identity` impossible to
implement, and as a consequence accessing elements of a container by
reference becomes difficult or impossible to typecheck properly. Also,
heap-allocated structures with deterministic destruction (e.g. reference
counted) must insert member copies for all accesses.

This proposal promotes adding `return` as an attribute that propagates
the lifetime of a parameter to the return value of a function. With the
proposed semantics, a function is disallowed to return a `ref` parameter
or a part thereof UNLESS the parameter is also annotated with `return`.
Under the proposed semantics `identity` will be spelled as follows:

``` {.D}
@safe ref int wrongIdentity(ref int x) { 
    return x; // ERROR! Cannot return a ref, please use "return ref"
}
@safe ref int identity(return ref int x) { 
    return x; // fine
}
```

Just by seeing the signature `ref` `int` `identity(return` `ref` `int`
`x)` the compiler assumes that the result of identity must have a
shorter or equal lifetime than `x` and typechecks callers accordingly.
Example (given the previous definition of `identity`):

``` {.D}
@safe ref int fun(return ref int x) { 
    int a;
    return a; // ERROR per current language rules
    static int b;
    return b; // fine per current language rules
    return identity(a); // ERROR, this may escape the address of a local
    return x; // fine, propagate x's lifetime to output
    return identity(x); // fine, propagate x's lifetime through identity to the output
    return identity(identity(x)); // fine, propagate x's lifetime twice through identity to the output
}

@safe ref int gun(ref int input) {
    static int[42] data;
    return data[input]; // works, can always return static-lived data
}

@safe struct S {
    private int x;
    ref int get() return { return x; } // should work, see next section 
}
```

### Interaction with `auto` `ref`

Syntactically it is illegal to use `auto` `ref` and `return` `ref` on
the same parameter. Deduction of the `return` attribute still applies as
discussed below.

### Deduction

Deduction of the `return` attribute will be effected under the same
conditions as for `pure` (currently for generic and lambda functions).
That means the generic `identity` function does not require the `return`
attribute:

``` {.D}
auto ref T identity(auto ref T x) {
    return x; // correct, no need for return
}
```

### Types of Result vs. Parameters

Consider:

``` {.D}
@safe ref int fun(return ref float x);
```

This function arguably cannot return a value scoped within the lifetime
of its argument for the simple reason it's impossible to find an `int`
somewhere in a `float` (apart from unsafe address manipulation).
However, this DIP ignores types; if a parameter is `return` `ref`, it is
always considered potentially escaped as a result. It is in fact
possible that the author of `fun` wants to constrain its output's
lifetime for unrelated reasons.

Future versions of this DIP may relax this rule.

### Multiple Parameters

If multiple `return` `ref` parameters are present, the result's lifetime
is conservatively assumed to be enclosed in the lifetime of the
shortest-lived of those arguments.

### Member Functions

Member functions of `struct`s must qualify `this` with `return` if they
want to return a result by `ref` that won't outlive `this`. Example:

``` {.D}
@safe struct S {
    static int a;
    int b;
    ref int fun() { return a; } // fine, callers assume infinite lifetime
    ref int gun() { return b; } // ERROR! Cannot return a direct member
    ref int hun() return { return b; } // fine, result is scoped within this
}
```

### @safe

For the initial release, the requirement of returns for `ref` parameter
data to be marked with `return` will only apply to `@safe` functions.
The reasons for this are to avoid breaking existing code, and because
it's not yet clear whether this feature will interfere with valid
constructs in a system language.

``` {.D}
@safe   ref int fun(ref int x)        { return x;} // Error
@safe   ref int gun(return ref int x) { return x;} // OK
@system ref int hun(ref int x)        { return x;} // OK for now, @system code.
@system ref int jun(return ref int x) { return x;} // preferred, gives more hints to compiler for lifetime of return value
```
