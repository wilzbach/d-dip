Abstract
--------

Virtual calls are inefficient, and through extensive discussion, it has
been shown that it is impossible for an optimiser to safely finalise
virtuals in any useful capacity in a non-JIT/VM environment. This DIP
proposes that class methods need to be non-virtual by default, or D
classes will always yield inferior performance characteristics to other
native languages.

In support of this change, introduction of the 'virtual' keyword will be
required, and a deprecation process similar to the introduction of
override will be followed. 'final' will be preserved, and remain useful
to effectively 'seal' a hierarchy, in the same way as is useful in Java,
C++, and C\# (via 'sealed').

Process
-------

Introduction of virtual would be added in steps:

1.  The virtual keyword is introduced; it becomes a warning to declare a
    virtual base function not marked virtual.
2.  deprecate declaring virtual functions not marked virtual.
3.  It becomes a compile error; virtual is enforced.

At this point, all methods are marked with either 'virtual', 'override',
'final', 'abstract', or are implicitly final.

Example
-------

```d
class Base
{
  f();  // <- warning->deprecated->error, f() is implicitly final
  virtual g();
  final h();
}

class Derived : Base
{
  override f()
  override g(); // <- valid
  override h(); // <- error, h() is explicitly final
}
```

Interfaces
----------

For brevity, it is safe to assume all methods of an interface are
implicitly virtual.

```d
interface Interface
{
  f(); // <- implicitly virtual
}

class Class : Interface
{
  override f(); // <- f() is declared in an interface, which is implicitly virtual
}
```
