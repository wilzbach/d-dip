Abstract
--------

An interface specification is a complete list of implemented functions
of an aggregate type.

Rationale
---------

It may at times be hard to get a full overview of the implemented
interface of a class, to find which member functions are there and what
their exact signatures are. While an interface may put a lower limit on
the implemented member functions, additional functions may be
implemented willy-nilly.

This DIP seeks to solve one of the main problems addressed by
[DIP47](DIP47 "wikilink"), albeit by a different route.

Syntax
------

Interface specifications add an optional section to aggregate types:

```d
class C {
    // Declaration
    interface {
        this(float)
        int foo();
        void bar(ref int n);
    }
    // Definition
    this(float f) {
    }
    int foo() {
        return 3;
    }
    void baz(ref int n) {
    }
}
```

Semantics
---------

1.  Parameter names may be omitted in the declaration, but must
    otherwise match those in the definition.
2.  Types, parameter types, attributes, and UDAs in declaration must be
    present in both locations.
3.  Default parameter values must be repeated in both locations or not
    at all.
4.  It is an error for @safe/@trusted/@system,
    private/package/public/export access, linkage and storage classes to
    differ between declaration and definition.

Existing Code
-------------

Interface specifications will not break any existing code.
