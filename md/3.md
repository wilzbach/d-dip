Abstract
--------

Non-public inheritance in a single inheritance language that has a
single root object hierarchy makes little sense.

Rationale
---------

Hiding 'Object' level attributes from a class leads to strange behavior.

Description
-----------

The compiler is behaving as spec'ed, but the value and correctness of
this part of the spec is in question.

The suggested change, effectively drop one line from the grammar.

```d
    SuperClass?:
        Identifier
        Protection Identifier // delete
```

An alternative would be for Object to always be forced to public
visibility even if there's a break in the public chain up to it.
