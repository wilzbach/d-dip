Abstract
--------

Currently the version of "deprecated" that takes a string literal
describing the deprecation can be used as an attribute, but not a
storage class. The version that does not take a description can be used
as both. This DIP will make the use of the "deprecated"
attribute/storage class more consistent.

Rationale
---------

It is confusing to the users of D that the following code compiles:

``` {.D}
deprecated i = 10;
```

but the following code does not:

``` {.D}
deprecated("This field will be removed in March 2017") i = 10;
```

Grammar Change
--------------

"deprecated" will be removed from the "StorageClass" grammar and
replaced with "DeprecatedAttribute".

Backwards Compatability
-----------------------

Because this change will allow previously invalid code to be valid, no
old code will need to be upgraded.
