Abstract
--------

This pattern has become quite common in D:

`   template isIntegral(T) {`
`     enum isIntegral = is(T : long) || is(T : ulong) || ...;`
`   }`

Analogously to struct S(T), the enum manifest constant could be written
as:

`   enum isIntegral(T) = is(T : long) || is(T : ulong) || ...;`

This is a natural fit for D. It does not break any existing code, and is
simple to implement - it's just a rewrite in the parser.

Rationale
---------

The pattern is common, and a bit awkward. It's worth supporting the new
syntactic sugar.
